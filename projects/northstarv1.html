This was because they had only started the year prior.&nbsp;During the information night that they had prior to applications, I learned that the team was interested in possibly designing their own telemetry systems to get information from the rocket. At first I was intrigued by this proposition, as well as since I already enjoyed rockets and electronics, I decided to apply to the team. After making it past the preliminary application process, I was given an interview time. To hopefully increase my chances of getting onto the team, I decided to put together a prototype telemetry system using two Arduinos and two simple radio modules in two weeks. During midterms. Although possibly not the brightest use of my time, it paid off in the end as I was accepted to the team.<br><br>After Joining Ontario Tech Space And Rocketry, I had assumed that we were going to be designing our own flight systems right off the bat, allowing me to finally learn PCB design. That was until I found out that the designing of custom systems was going to have to wait until the next year.<br><br>Since we weren't going to be making anything "custom" until the future, I decided to take matters into my own hands and make my own flight computer.</p></section><section class="d-md-flex d-xl-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center align-items-md-center justify-content-xl-center"><h3>How do I make a flight computer</h3><p style="max-width: 45em;">In order for me to make a flight computer, I first needed to <em>design</em>&nbsp;a flight computer. And in order to design a flight computer, I needed a software to design it with. For this, I chose KiCAD, due to its being open source, as well as the large community support and ease of use. Now that I had a pot, I needed to figure out what would control the board.<br><br>When it comes to micro controllers, there are a lot on the market, of which they all have different levels of support, complexity, ease of use, power draw, number of cores, and more. All of these criteria make finding the <em>perfect</em>&nbsp;MCU nigh impossible, so instead of searching for the perfect one, I chose one that would be reasonable: the RP2040, which is the MCU of the relatively new, pretty widely used Raspberry Pi Pico. I mainly chose it because it seemed cool, but is not only cheap for its feature set, but also in general, allowing me to keep prices down.</p></section><section class="d-md-flex d-xl-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center align-items-md-center justify-content-xl-center"><h3>On a roll</h3><p style="max-width: 45em;">Having worked with Arduinos and several of its peripherals in the past, I had a relatively good understanding of how the common communications protocols worked, and what were required for them to run well. In that regard, I had tried with this board to make my life easier by having most of the peripherals (TBC)</p></section><footer class="text-center bg-dark"><div class="container text-white py-4 py-lg-5"><ul class="list-inline d-flex flex-row justify-content-center align-items-center align-content-center justify-content-md-center align-items-md-end"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2" style="margin-right: 12px;margin-left: 12px;"><a class="link-light" href="../projects.html">Projects</a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2"><a class="link-light" href="#">CV</a></li><li class="list-inline-item mx-2"><a class="link-light" href="#">Blog</a></li></ul><ul class="list-inline d-md-flex justify-content-md-center align-items-md-center"><li class="list-inline-item mx-2"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianlaforest/"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 16 16" class="bi bi-linkedin text-light">
